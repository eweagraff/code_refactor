# Code Refactor for Horiseon Marketing Agency

## Description:

## By providing a code refactor for Horiseon Marketing Agency, I was able to make the code more accessible and user friendly. The initial code was lacking HTML semantics and structure. There were no alt tags, so I created alt tags to comply with current accessibility standards. The CSS file was not consolidated and ended up being repetative becase a lot of the code for the styling was the same for the given classes. The overall design and functionality of the webpage was not altered, however now the code is readable and has been consolidated to reduce redunancies and therefore is more efficient.

## Hannah Folk, my tutor, helped with the refactoring of this code. She helped guide me by reviewing the code and deciding what could be consolidated in the CSS file as well as the overall structure/semantics of the HTML file. I also reviewed Githubs guide to create a proper README file : (https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide)
